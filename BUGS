- There is a lot of angular moment during execution. Maybe is the pressure contraint?
- Strain constraint at maximum level should be able to fully impede growth in that direction
- Cells cannot be remeshed during execution. They tend to explode after remeshing, is it a constraint problem? Possibly shape or pressure
